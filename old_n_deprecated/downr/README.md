### downr.sh

This was a project from years ago that was only used for a short time (and is really sloppy). It's a shell script to automate the download of files from raspishare.com, hotfile.com, or megashares.com. It was inspired by scripts like `rapid.pl`, `rapidsucker.pl`, and `rsdown`.  Hasn't even been used in almost 10 years, probably broken.
